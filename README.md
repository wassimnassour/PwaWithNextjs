## things you should be aware of

- when you build PWA,the user can start selecting things like the text in button or titles , so you want to give the best experience , you can add user-select:none and -webkit-user-select:none to your tag or class to make sure that user can't select this text

- when you use standalone if thereâ€™s any button or anything in the safe area , you canâ€™t access cuz the the phone is using it we can use media with display mode

  ```css
  @media (display-mode: standalone) {
    padding-bottom: 32px;
  }
  ```

  you can also use [env](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env) from css to fill the screen when you are working with rotation screen
